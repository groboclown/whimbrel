# Setting up Whimbrel

Whimbrel requires some setup with AWS in order to get it working properly.

## Dependencies

The setup script uses Python 2.7 or 3.3 (or better) to load up the configuration.
This needs the boto3 python library installed in your configuration.  Make sure
you follow the steps described in
[the boto3 configuration documentation](https://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/quickstart.html#configuration)
to setup the library to use your AWS credentials.


# Configuration

Setup your configuration file like so:


# Initial Setup


# Subsequent Setup and Upgrades
