# Use Case: Simple API Clients and Decision Lambdas

If the clients use the Simple API, then the decision processing must be called out
by the AWS Lambda triggers.  This use case shows how the smart Lambda triggers
that control the Whimbrel state can fire the execution of custom Lambda logic
to make smart decisions.
